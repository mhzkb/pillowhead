# Pillowhead
## 3D printable Corne Mini wireless case

Pillowhead is a case for the 5 column version of Corne. The case is intended for wireless use; there are no cut-outs for TRRS connectors. The case design is based on the Corne Classic v2 but should fit other versions with the possible exception of the reset button position.

**This case will not fit Corne v4 as the thumb keys are positioned differently.**

The case is assembled with the following hardware:
- M2 screws (6-8 mm)
- M2 X D3 X L3 heatset inserts - slightly wider and longer inserts may also work.
- Rubber feet (optional)

Suggested print settings
- 0.4 mm nozzle
- 0.16-0.2 mm layer height
- Minimum 5 top/bottom layers
- Minimum 3 walls
- 20 % infill
- Paint-on supports for the USB cutout (depending on your printers bridging abilities)
- Mirror STLs in slicer for right half

FreeCAD file included for reference (it's messy!).
